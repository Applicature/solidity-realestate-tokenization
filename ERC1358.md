# ERC-1358
## Overview
New approach for Token Standards, was created taking all best features of ERC 721, combined with ERC 20 compatible interface, gives a lot of opportunities for business. Due to ERC 721 token nature it brings non-fungibility and now it is supplied by ERC 20’s, in respect of that, your stake in ERC 20's tokens define your portion for non-fungible token, which could be presented like unique crypto asset, as example you could build shareholding or collaborative trading over of ERC 1358 NFT.

## Internal process

This standard outlines a smart contract interface, which allow to create a Non-Fungible assets, each of them are supplied by Fungible Token in a separate contract, with ERC-20 compatibility. Existing standards such as ERC-721 can not provide enough features and functionality in order to be supplied by another asset. The ERC-721 standard’s Token ID is a single non-fungible unique identifier (index) and the set of such NF’s is deployed as a single contract with settings for the entire collection. Unlike, the ERC-1358 Non-Fungible ERC-20 Compatible Token allows to create Fungible Token with predefined token supply, that will be value conformity for a set of Non-Fungible tokens.

The entry point to the pipeline of creating Non-Fungible Token, which value is supplied by Fungible once with ERC-20 compatibility starts from ‘mint’ function. Under the hood ‘mint’ creates Fungible token with specified owner and supply and then establish Non-Fungible one, both tokens are linked between each other. By granting binding between NFT and FT we gain an opportunity to create a set of NFT’s, with different owners, balance of Fungible Token for each holder in relative to NFT determines the measure of his possessions to Non-Fungible asset.

**Fungible token requires:**

- name 
- symbol
- decimals
- total supply
- address of ERC-1358 NFT
- address of owner
- NFT token id

Name,  symbol, decimals and total supply are integral local variables of ERC-20 compatible interface. Address of ERC-1358 NFT is an address of NFT base contract, which initialize TGE of FT contract. NFT token id is a unique identifier of NFT, which is related to this FT.


**Non-Fungbile token requires:**
- token id
- owner

Token id is unique identifier for NFT, owner is address to whom belongs NFT ownership

**Non-Fungible base contract requires:**
- name
- symbol
